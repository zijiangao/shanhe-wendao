# Building 山河问道

## Requirements

- Godot 4.7.1 stable
- Godot 4.7.1 Windows export templates

## Run automated tests

From the repository root, run each test scene headlessly:

```powershell
$godot = "C:\path\to\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe"
$project = Join-Path $PWD "godot"
$tests = @(
    "test_game_state.gd",
    "test_save_manager.gd",
    "test_battle_rules.gd",
    "test_battle_engine.gd",
    "test_combat_feedback.gd",
    "test_encounter_rules.gd",
    "test_battle_scene_spec.gd",
    "test_settings_manager.gd",
    "test_difficulty_rules.gd",
    "test_location_art.gd",
    "test_release_credits.gd",
    "test_store_capture_spec.gd",
    "test_onboarding_spec.gd",
    "test_growth_rules.gd",
	"test_crafting_rules.gd",
	"test_herbarium_rules.gd",
	"test_mineralogy_rules.gd",
    "test_training_minigame_rules.gd",
	"test_training_event_rules.gd",
    "test_reward_rules.gd",
    "test_navigation_rules.gd",
    "test_tutorial_rules.gd",
    "test_cue_synth.gd",
    "test_steam_service.gd",
    "test_demo_policy.gd"
)

foreach ($test in $tests) {
    & $godot --headless --path $project --script ("res://tests/" + $test)
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "$test failed" }
}
```

Run the independent SteamPipe preparation regression test after the Godot suite:

```powershell
& .\steamworks\scripts\test_prepare_steampipe.ps1
```

## Preview the battle reward choice

Capture the save-backed three-way reward screen at 1280×720 for visual QA:

```powershell
& $godot --path $project --script res://tests/test_reward_choice_view.gd
```

Godot writes `reward_choice_preview.png` to the project user-data folder and exits non-zero if the pending reward state is missing.

Render the complete settings panel after UI changes:

```powershell
& $godot --path $project --script res://tests/test_settings_view.gd
```

Godot writes `settings_preview.png` to the project user-data folder and verifies that fullscreen, screen-shake, and combat-flash controls are present.

`controls_preview.png` verifies the dedicated keyboard-binding screen. Direction keys and controller navigation remain available alongside four persistent physical-key bindings; conflicts swap keys, while Enter and Esc stay reserved for confirm/cancel.

Capture a live martial-skill impact frame after changing combat presentation:

```powershell
& $godot --path $project --script res://tests/test_combat_feedback_view.gd

& $godot --path $project --script res://tests/test_training_minigame_view.gd

& $godot --path $project --script res://tests/test_crafting_view.gd

& $godot --path $project --script res://tests/test_pause_view.gd

& $godot --path $project --script res://tests/test_achievements_view.gd

& $godot --path $project --script res://tests/test_controls_view.gd
```

The training preview covers the advanced three-technique sword sequence, the short-echo mining window, and the final mining score/reward card with a personal-best banner, mineral discovery, and encounter panels. Each discipline introduces an advanced variant after round one: three-step sword forms, delayed blade counters, paired herb-root deductions, or short mining echoes. Training streaks begin at 85 points, grant capped +5/+10 combo bonuses, and reset on a miss; the packaged training verifier checks a three-round 315-point streak across basic and advanced rounds. Exact best score, best streak, and attempt count persist independently for all four disciplines and are summarized on the character screen. High grades also improve the chance of one of eight specialty encounters; their material, currency, cultivation, consumable, or health effects are committed in the same save-backed transaction as the normal reward. Herbalism and mining grades unlock increasingly broad four-entry specimen pools, prioritize undiscovered finds, and persist their field guides. First herb discoveries grant cultivation while first mineral appraisals grant silver exactly once.

Godot writes `combat_feedback_preview.png` to the project user-data folder after exercising the real skill-impact animation path.

Verify the packaged one-time reward flow from either exported executable:

```powershell
& "..\build\windows\ShanheWendao.exe" -- --verify-reward-flow
```

Verify packaged feedback tiers, heavy-impact events, and accessibility settings:

```powershell
& "..\build\windows\ShanheWendao.exe" -- --verify-combat-feedback
```

The save-manager test deliberately feeds malformed and future-version save files to verify recovery, so warning/error log lines from those fixtures are expected.

The main scene also provides a release presentation verifier. It instantiates the real tactical battle view, plays movement, attack, damage, guard, and boss-technique events, then exits with a non-zero code if the input lock was not released:

```powershell
& $godot --headless --path $project -- --verify-battle-presentation
```

The onboarding verifier checks the shipping new-game route from Qingyun mission acceptance through unlocking the first Blackreed battle:

```powershell
& $godot --headless --path $project -- --verify-onboarding-flow

& $godot --headless --path $project -- --verify-training-flow

& $godot --headless --path $project -- --verify-crafting-flow

& $godot --headless --path $project -- --verify-pause-flow
```

The exported-build Steam data verifier checks that all 15 achievement definitions have stable API names and complete metadata. Besides story and ending progress, the set includes persistent milestones for an S-grade training result, a training encounter, field medicine, and weapon tempering; `STAT_HIGHEST_SPECIALTY` mirrors the player's strongest specialty:

```powershell
& "..\build\windows\ShanheWendao.exe" -- --verify-steam-data
```

## Export Windows Release

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path (Join-Path $PWD "build/windows") | Out-Null
& $godot --headless --path $project --export-release "Windows Desktop"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path (Join-Path $PWD "build/windows-demo") | Out-Null
& $godot --headless --path $project --export-release "Windows Demo"
```

The Windows release is written to `build/windows/ShanheWendao.exe` with `ShanheWendao.pck` beside it. Both files are required. Keeping game content separate improves SteamPipe patch behavior. The `build` directory is intentionally ignored by Git.

The demo is written separately to `build/windows-demo/ShanheWendaoDemo.exe` with `ShanheWendaoDemo.pck`. Its `demo` custom feature enforces the Blackreed victory boundary; the full preset has no such feature.

To visually review the second first-battle tutorial page from the shipping UI, run the full build with `--capture-tactical-tutorial`. It writes `tactical_tutorial_preview.png` to the Godot user-data folder and exits non-zero if the expected tutorial page was not active.

## Capture Steam store screenshots

After exporting the full Windows release, run the shipping executable with `--capture-store-screenshots`. It creates eight deterministic 1920×1080 gameplay PNGs under the Godot user-data folder in `store_screenshots`. These are candidate captures from the actual release UI; visually review every image before uploading it to Steam.

```powershell
& "..\build\windows\ShanheWendao.exe" -- --capture-store-screenshots
```

Before a public Steam release, review `ASSET_PROVENANCE.md` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, replace the current provisional application icon only after the final brand and art-rights review, and configure code signing in the Windows export preset.
